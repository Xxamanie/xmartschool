SUPABASE ACTION PLAN (CURRENT)
==============================

STATUS
------
Supabase is treated as infrastructure for PostgreSQL (and optional frontend auth session support).
Primary application data access is through backend API + Prisma.

CHECKLIST
---------
1) Verify backend env:
   - DATABASE_URL is set correctly in deployment platform
   - NODE_ENV=production
   - FRONTEND_URL matches deployed frontend origin

2) Verify backend health:
   - GET /api/health returns ok=true

3) Verify database schema:
   - Run prisma generate during build
   - Run prisma migrate deploy for production rollout

4) Verify frontend config:
   - VITE_API_BASE_URL points to backend /api
   - Supabase vars are set only if auth session integration is required

5) Run smoke tests:
   - Staff login
   - Student verification
   - Student/subject CRUD
   - Attendance read/write

NOTES
-----
- Do not use this file for storing credentials.
- Keep all secrets in deployment environment variable managers.
